# SDVX Charts for KShootMania #

SDVX Song packages meant for use in KShootMania. 

These charts follows the offical sdvx charts closely to emulate the original experience.

## Setting up the charts ##
1. Empty out the directory of "kshootmania\songs"
2. Clone the repository directly into "kshootmania\songs"

You may revert your directory to its original state after cloning (This repository is configured to ignore all other songs)

We configure the directory this way for easy editing and playing the charts.
